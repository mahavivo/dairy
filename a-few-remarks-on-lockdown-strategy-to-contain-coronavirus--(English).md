> As countries start announcing mass stay-at-home orders, I have a new favorite #nCoV19 graph. Instead of measuring cases by days, I measured cases since a large-scale control measure. And it explains a lot.

@mahavivo

very interesting graph. I would like to make a few remarks about it. Given you probably understand Chinese and I am not really good at writing in English, so I will comment in Chinese.

—**machine translation** (via https://www.deepl.com/translator)

1\. The massive territory-wide lockdown was effective and the effect was quickly demonstrated, with a peak in the number of new confirmed cases seen in about 17 days, then a slow decline, a peak in the number of deaths seen in about 30 days, then a slow decline, and after about two months, the epidemic was almost over, with zero or near zero new cases.

2\. This situation can be observed in the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China, and in fact, you can see the same pattern in the SARS outbreak in 2003 and even in the MERS outbreak in Korea.

3\. The start of the Chinese domestic coronavirus lockdown should actually have been January 20, 2020, the day Xi Jinping spoke publicly, not January 23, when Wuhan sealed the city. Similarly, the SARS epidemic lockdown is to be counted roughly from April 12, 2003, the day Hu Jintao spoke in Shenzhen. Previously, Dr. Jiang Yanyong's April 7 disclosure forced the government to make public the situation of SARS pandemic.

4\. The real pressure to make the Chinese Communist Party disclose both epidemics came from outside the country/international community, in the case of SARS it was Jiang Yanyong who broke the news in the international media, and in the case of Wuhan virus, the coronavirus cases from China were discovered in Thailand (13 January) and Japan (16 January) in succession.

5\. Why is there a peak in confirmed cases 17 days after lockdown and a peak in deaths at 30 days? This starts with the mechanism of transmission and pathogenesis of coronavirus pneumonia.

6\. The median incubation period for coronavirus is five days, with a critical period two weeks after onset, either the immune system overcomes the virus or the virus conquers and causes death. A rough estimate based on current data is that death would occur three weeks after the onset if not self-cured.

7\. Prior to lockdown, there were many channels of transmission, such as public transport, mass gatherings (concerts, church gatherings), offices, schools, shopping malls, restaurants/bars, cinemas, bookstores, and within the home, but after lockdown, transmission in public places was largely cut off and the main channel of transmission was within the home. However, since mass transmission had already occurred and people had retreated to their homes, there was more contact between family members and transmission would continue, but mainly within family members.

8\. After lockdown, the previously infected family member A develops the disease on day 5, and he will seek medical attention, while at the same time, because he was asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic and in close contact with family members, he has already transmitted the virus to family member B (or possibly C, etc.), and A is diagnosed on day 7 after seeing a doctor (this includes a delay in seeking medical attention after the disease has occurred, queuing up for tests - there is a bottleneck in testing capacity, the tests themselves take time, etc.), while at the same time family member B (and possibly C) develops the disease (10 days after lockdown, two incubation periods), and because of the knowledge of intra-household transmission, even a fool would take measures to isolate all family members, thus cutting off the channels of intra-household transmission and leaving no possibility for further transmission.

9\. Family members B and C will seek medical attention and be diagnosed after 7 days, at which point the peak of confirmed cases will be reached around 5 + 5 + 7 = 17 days after lockdown. Because family members B and C were infected with the virus on day 5 and developed the disease on day 10, the peak of this onset of symptoms determined that the highest number of deaths would be seen three weeks later, about a month later.

10\. Using the actual situation in China to verify. The lockdown started on January 20, 2020, peaked around February 6 with new confirmed cases and then gradually declined, reaching a peak in deaths on February 18 and then gradually declining. SARS in 2003 and MERS in Korea in 2015 are similar, see the relevant information.

11\. This model allows for a rough prediction of the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy. Italy's lockdown time can be counted as either March 8 or March 10, so the peak of new confirmed cases will be 17 days later, around March 26, and the peak of deaths will be around April 8. Two months later, around May 8, the number of new cases will be reduced to zero or close to zero.

12\. Also with reference to the total number of confirmed cases and deaths in China, the total number of confirmed cases and deaths in Italy will probably reach 120,000 to 150,000, with a terrible death toll of around 20,000 and a mortality rate that will be twice the current crude death rate of 8 per cent, or around 16 per cent.

13\. It is assumed that the average time from onset to death is three weeks, which is the statistical data from China. Having just read some new reports that the average time interval between onset and death in Italy is 8 days, the estimate of the peak of the above-mentioned deaths has to be adjusted to 5 + 5 + 8 = 18 days later, i.e. around 27 March.

14\. Correspondingly, the estimate of the overall number of deaths in Italy has to be adjusted, which is about 10,000-12,000, with a mortality rate of 8-10 per cent, still relatively horrible.

15\. The same goes for lockdown, where the severity of the measures taken varies from country to country. As we all know, China is a totalitarian state, and the resources, human, material and financial, that can be mobilized after the President has issued a general mobilization order are amazing. I've seen some comments online that other countries can copy China's "anti-epidemic" model, which is very ridiculous, because it means you have to copy the party secretary and the "red armband" too.

16\. Without going into what the Party Secretary is, the essence of the "red armband" is to temporarily convert more than 10 million grass-roots cadres and staff into police and law enforcement officers in order to implement a complete and total lockdown, leaving 1.4 billion people behind bars and in solitary confinement, to stop the chain of transmission of the coronavirus.

17\. Democracies, however, need not be overly concerned and could follow the example of the Republic of Korea by not imposing a drastic lockdown, introducing universal testing and isolating infected persons in a timely manner. Another advantage of these developed countries is their high degree of civilization and the fact that their people have good hygiene habits and a high sense of public morality and are able to obey the rules of distancing consciously.

18\. The late issuance of the Italian lockdown, the laxity of the measures and the possible bottlenecks in nucleic acid testing capacity are not favourable to the prevention and control of the epidemic, but have the sad "advantage" that the number of confirmed cases, deaths and mortality rates appear alarming enough to prompt the population to take a high degree of caution in self-protection, which in China requires government enforcement.

19\. I would like to make some preliminary comments on the United States' epidemic prevention policy. It would be wrong to think that the US locked down or took draconian precautions on March 13. The stay-at-home order is much weaker than the Chinese general mobilization and city blockade order, and the Italian territory-wide blockade. Moreover, the American people are more free and loose, with a strong rebellious mentality, with a stay-at-home order, he may not necessarily listen to you, and still live as before.

20\. Since the United States has adopted a gradual tightening of the lockdown policy, which varies from state to state, it is more difficult to determine the exact date of the lockdown, which I thought could be roughly considered to be between 18 and 20 March, when schools were generally closed, visas were suspended at embassies abroad and Trump issued a call for "15 Days to Slow the Spread".

21\. So is it possible to slow the spread of the virus for 15 days or not? Still very promising, but according to my projection model it is 17 days to reach the effect of slowdown, with the number of new cases peaking at this time (April 5) and slowly declining thereafter. To achieve "15 Days to Slow the Spread", it is necessary to actively screen people with fever and speed up testing so that the time between onset and diagnosis is reduced to five days instead of seven days for people infected.

22\. One of the major strengths of the United States epidemic response is the high level of science and technology, the availability of adequate medical personnel and facilities, and the large number of laboratories that can perform nucleic acid tests for the virus, which creates the conditions for rapid diagnosis and early isolation of infected persons, thus achieving a near Korean-style victory against the epidemic.

23\. Let me make some of the aforementioned concepts a little clearer. Prior to the lockdown, there were both frequent movements and mass gatherings of people in normal society. When there are frequent movements, there are "King of Virus" and super-spreaders who spread the virus everywhere, and when they gather on a large scale, there will be super-spreading events such as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Korea and the Biogen Corporation Conference in the United States.

24\. The occurrence of super-transmitters and super-transmission events will cause the number of infected persons to increase rapidly, 1 X 200, 200 infected persons contacting an average of 50 more persons each, 200 X 50 = 10,000, and secondary infections, along with other mini super-transmissions, will soon render contact tracing, a key epidemiological investigative tool, unusable, cases will flare up everywhere and everything will fall into chaos.

25\. Cluelessness, the inability to trace the chain of transmission of viruses in the event of a plague outbreak and thus isolate them is a major blunder to fighting the epidemic because it means that you face hidden enemies that are nowhere (possibly everywhere) and that are growing exponentially. At this point, Lockdown, home shelter, serves to completely eliminaite the large and small super-transmissions that inevitably lead to chaos, forcing the following chain of virus transmission to be fixed (home) and quantified (number of family members).

26\. Following the "fixed spot" and "quantified member", time and resources were secured for the Government, hospitals and society to deal with the existing cases, while slowing down the spread of the virus. Those infected whose disease has been identified are quarantined, either healed themselves, cured, or died, and the old virus will be completely eliminated and will not survive to spread.

27\. The virus, which has taken refuge with the asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic infected people at Home, will soon face extinction as well. First, it can only infect your entire family at most, and second, it usually only lasts one, two, or three generations.

28\. Since it is a home refuge, with no contact with outsiders, it is easy to understand that the virus infects at most all family members. The generation of virus transmission needs further explanation. This is the case for one generation of transmission - the infected person who carries the virus does not transmit it to the family, but only develops it himself and is isolated and diagnosed in time. This is more fortunate and less likely to be conjectured, since each person's closest contact is necessarily his or her own family, and the condition of the home creates a great deal of time and opportunity for close contact.

29\. The virus is transmitted in the family for two generations. It should be the most common scenario in which an asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic infected person transmits the virus to a family member (which can be one, two or three, four or five people) after it has become infectious (five days or more, see studies), and the transmitter, the infected person, is unaware of it until one of them is sick (usually the previous transmitter is first sick).

30\. Families should take precautions when a person has an illness (whether cold, flu or coronavirus pneumonia), when the illness is diagnosed as coronavirus pneumonia, and when families should be kept in strict isolation from each other in case of panic, but they already have a second-generation infected person in the family, as mentioned above. Since everyone is isolated, infected or not, there is no longer any chance of the virus continuing to spread.

31\. Transmission within the family should be relatively low in three (or four) generations, A to B, B to C, C to D, and none of them have developed the disease after 10 to 15 days. It's entirely possible, but makes little sense in the context of the current discussion, without going into detail.

32\. The dominance of two-generation transmission within the family (whether one, two, three or four) determines that the peak period of infection after lockdown is after 5 + 5 = 10 days, which is a constant/fixed value by the average incubation period of 5 days for coronavirus. Unless there are really species differences between people.

33\. The time interval between onset and diagnosis is variable. In different countries and regions, there are differences in the number of medical personnel, the conditions of medical facilities, the diagnostic process, the adequacy of test reagents, and even if they are the same, there are differences in whether they are overwhelmed by a major outbreak of the plague. The time period from onset to diagnosis is said to be usually one week (7 days) in China.

34\. The test for coronavirus pneumonia is not as simple as one might think, with a fever on the first day, a visit to the hospital on the second day, an immediate test with a virus kit, and then the results in the afternoon or on the third day. Because there are countless reasons for fever and cough, and winter is a flu season, the first thing to rule out is that you actually have other illnesses, such as cold and flu, bacterial pneumonia, and a whole host of tests.

35\. Secondly, because of the current scarcity and/or cost of testing kits and the shortage of testing personnel and equipment, even if you are suspected to be infected with coronavirus , a CT pre-test is required to determine whether the condition is serious, whether there is an urgent need for viral nucleic acid testing, whether hospitalization is required, etc., which will prolong the time for a confirmed diagnosis.

36\. Third, after passing a pre-test for nucleic acid, which is likely to be negative because of your low viral load, you will have to wait some time for the disease to progress and retest.

37\. A factor to be taken into account is the length of time that an infected person has been sick before seeing a doctor. Immediately; the next day; after three days of rest at home and not well enough to go to the hospital again.

38\. All of these time costs add up to the final determination of how long it takes from onset to diagnosis of coronavirus. It can be long or short. Longer ones, such as in the early days of Wuhan, Wuhan City as a whole (about 7 days, with the peak of confirmed cases around February 7, excluding sudden increases due to changes in statistical methods), and shorter ones, such as in other resource-constrained provinces in the country (except Hubei), 4-5 days, with the peak of confirmed cases around February 4.

39\. Another example of short consumption times is the Republic of Korea, where the mobilization order can be counted from 18 February and reaches its peak of confirmed cases on 1 March. It can be assumed that the disease may take only three days to be confirmed. There are many reasons for the fast detection speed in Korea, which will not be expanded here.

40\. After lockdown, onset peak (10th day) + average time to diagnosis (7 days) = peak of new confirmed cases.

41\. The peak of deaths can be determined by the average time interval between onset of illness and death. In China, this time is about 3 weeks, with some authoritative papers saying 18.5 days (Cao Bin et al., The Lancet) and some statistics saying 14 or 22 days; according to newer studies, the average time from onset to death in Italy is 8 days.

42\. The rapid deterioration of the disease in Italy is probably due mainly to the fact that the infected persons who die are very old (average 80 years), have low immunity and suffer from a number of underlying conditions.

43\. Strictly speaking, therefore, the time from onset to death is as variable as the time from onset to diagnosis, which is also variable. For the present, the range of its changes is between 8 and 22 days. Since Italy is relatively exceptional, it can be considered in general discussion as 18 days.

44\. After lockdown, onset peak (10th day) + average time from onset to death (18 days) = 28 days, which is the peak of new deaths.

45\. This assumption can be checked tentatively here with data from Korea. The start date of the South Korean mobilization order is February 18, and the current peak point for new deaths should fall near March 16, although this statistic needs to be kept under observation due to the small sample size.

46\. First, look at some of the graphs. (1) New daily number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Korea; (2) New daily number of deaths of coronavirus in China; (3) SARS events in 2003; (4) Typical normal distribution chart

![4](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*oprMDJmWvUseAW7b9xDonQ.png)

47\. It is reasonable to assume from simple observation that the curve of the number of new cases and deaths per day from coronavirus pneumonia is a normal distribution under the lockdown measure. The apex position of this curve is the 17th and 28th day of our previous estimation, respectively, and as long as the data are available for the first half of the normal distribution, it is possible to fit a constructed function to predict the data thereafter.

48\. On second thoughts, it is more appropriate to fit the prediction with a logistic function, which is itself used to describe population growth under constraints, slow at both ends, steepest in the middle. The middle position of the normal distribution function tends to moderate and does not correspond to the actual situation.

![2](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*8hbMy2B9b79vNm2SDwZ-Lw.png)

49\. A Python program to fit a logistic model to predict the cumulative daily confirmed cases in Italy is available at https://gist.github.com/mahavivo/646118d2c918a02202b4dba9c90ff608. Based on the current data, the number of people infected with the coronavirus in Italy could eventually reach 150,000.

50\. I would like to discuss below the circumstances under which a country or area must be in lockdown. That is to say, at this point, you have to lock down, and if you don't actively lock down, the population will be terrified by the exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths, and thus society as a whole will be passively locked down.

51\. Based on the current development of the coronavirus epidemic in various countries and regions and the response measures taken, the following eight types can be roughly classified: 1) complete isolation, represented by North Korea; 2) early closure of customs, with few cases, typically Taiwan; 3) timely measures and slow progress, represented by Hong Kong and Singapore; and 4) lukewarm, with an arguable policy, typically Japan.

52\. 5) accidental outbreak, well-controlled and represented by Korea; 6) inadequate prevention and control, with a critical epidemic, typical of Iran; 7) rapid development, forced to blockade cities, as in the case of Italy and the United States; 8) initial incompetence and failure, then overreaction, with the most severe lockdown measures in the world, speaking of course of China.

53\. The first three are examples of success for the moment. The common features are: first, the first time to shut down the border, if not, strict quarantine at the entry gate. Secondly, after entering sporadic cases, isolation treatment was performed for serious contact tracing. Third, adopt a policy of social distancing to prevent super-spreader and super-spreading events. Fourth, active testing to identify hidden carriers for isolation.

54\. The key in this situation is the need to keep the chain of transmission of each case of infection traceable and trace to imported persons outside the country, even if sporadic community transmission occurs, and to investigate extensively so that the trail of infection can be traced and unknown sources eliminated. As long as the chain of transmission continues, close contacts are isolated in a timely manner and confirmed cases are detected, the development of the epidemic can be controlled.

55\. Japan's epidemic prevention strategy was worth exploring, and there had been cases of mega-transmissions such as the Diamond Princess cruise. Personally, I think Japan's policy has been to go on the brink of danger, both to prevent the epidemic and to save the Olympics, and the result may not be a win-win, but rather a failure of both.

56\. Japan's main failure was the failure to introduce universal testing (even rejected one person who donated a million kits), which left a significant number of asymptomatic infected persons untouched, creating a large number of "isolated" cases of broken transmission chains and making contact tracing for epidemiological investigations difficult or impossible. Now one can only watch as the number of confirmed cases slowly grows, falling increasingly into a state of chaos in the distribution of cases.

57\. This chaotic situation is deadly, forcing the prevention and control of the epidemic to shift from proactive to reactive defence. “Preventable and controllable”, provided you know where to go to prevent and control which people, and the chaos of the epidemic will make everyone a target for prevention and control that cannot be implemented, or rather, cannot be effectively implemented. As a result, only one case can bubble up to deal with another.

58\. A comparison can be made with Japan's prevention and control strategy. South Korea, which had been a mediocre country, suddenly experienced a massive outbreak of collective infection in Daegu by the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, with a total number of 4,000-5,000 people, in addition to the nearby Gyeongsangbuk-do. While it was clear that the situation was about to get completely out of hand, South Korea has taken two key steps: first, the strict closure of key infected areas and second, the introduction of universal virus testing throughout the country.

59\. The timely closure of the key epidemic areas is tantamount to turning the entire region into a Diamond Princess cruise ship docked at sea, and while the absolute numbers are large, they are not terrible. In the case of extensive testing, this means that asymptomatic infected persons are thoroughly screened and isolated, cutting off the insidious channels of transmission of the coronavirus. The effect of these two measures is to allow the preexisting infected person to die or be cured in isolation and the virus itself to die out.

60\. By safely isolating as many people as possible from the virus, Korea had effectively returned to its original state of being without a major plague outbreak. There may be a small number of asymptomatic infections that have been missed, but there is no need to worry about it. If it remains asymptomatic, it does not exist.

61\. The significance of large-scale testing is to resurface the chain of transmission of the virus, which has been interrupted in the eyes of defenders and controllers, so that contact tracing, a basic plague control tool, can be resumed. This is equivalent to jumping from category 5 to categories 2 and 3, represented by Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

62\. Universal testing, both for nucleic acids (carriers of the virus) and antibodies (previous infection with the virus). When the epidemiological investigation did not find the carriers in close contact, lost the trail, the antibodies were checked again, and if someone was found to have developed antibodies, indicating an infection, it was likely an uplink transmitter, and the chain of transmission was restored by going forward.

63\. The situation in Iran is difficult to describe; we only know that the people are miserable, but we do not know how miserable, and we probably know that the Government may be working hard (infecting so many officials), but we do not know what it is spending its efforts on. In this country, someone blows up one of their own generals, their own response is to trample dozens of people to death at a funeral, and then their own army shoots down a civilian aircraft in their own country, and everything is chaotic and absurd.

64\. Iran's current performance has been a failure, with a total of over 20,000 cases and a nationwide outbreak, with no major epidemic areas to be identified, a consequence of the failure to block traffic early. Schools, shopping malls and mosques may be closed late for complicated reasons, but they are all wrong moves.

65\. If we go back in time to 22 February, when Iran reported 28 cases and 6 deaths, can Iran control the rapid development of the plague without immediately lockdown? The answer is no. According to current academic research, in the early days of the coronavirus epidemic, one death actually meant that there had been 800 cases, then six deaths, indicating that the actual infected persons had reached 4,800 by then.

66\. Where exactly are the 4800 infected persons, of whom perhaps 20 per cent are asymptomatic, and the inadequacy of Iranian testing reagents, which makes epidemiological investigations impossible to find out the 4800 infected persons in a population of 80 million. Even if 2,500 people are found first, with an average of 50 contacts each, 125,000 people have to be investigated and tested and diagnosed in the short term, otherwise the investigation is not completed and the next victim is infected.

67\. The Iranian Government was initially reluctant to lockdown, but later moved towards a substantive lockdown when epidemiological investigations were no longer possible and the situation was completely out of control, and the earliest possible date could be marked by a general school closure, i.e. 5 March. The late ones were the mall and mosque closures on March 13 and 16, respectively.

68\. "He who is willing, fate leads the way. Those who do not, fate drags." -- "He who is willing, the virus leads the way. Those who do not, the virus drags." When the number of cases of coronavirus infection in a certain region of a country is high, growing rapidly, and is so chaotic and fragmented that there are no clues to contact tracing to carry out epidemiological investigations, then lockdown is required.

69\. Korea is unlucky and a little lucky at the same time. Plague cases are concentrated, mainly in Daegu City and Gyeongsangbuk Province; experience in dealing with MERS; technical means to implement large-scale testing. The total number of confirmed cases in Korea is high, over 8,000, but excluding Daegu City and Gyeongsangbuk-do, there are only about 1,000 cases. Locking down the key epidemic areas is actually equivalent to jumping to category 4 in Japan and still allowing epidemiological investigations.

70\. Iran, on the other hand, had no way of jumping back to South Korea's category 5, let alone 4, 3, 2, from the very beginning, leaving only the territory-wide blockade.

71\. We already know the story of China, Italy and the United States of America, which had to "lock down" their countries because of the seriousness of the coroanvirus plague, and I would like to summarize their common characteristics before the lockdown. First, there is a cluster of infections in the community, the source of which can no longer be traced; second, there are many isolated cases in the region (city) outside the community that are not linked to the community; and third, infected persons from the country have been found not only in the country but also abroad.

72\. Fourth, the number of new cases and deaths is increasing rapidly and is scattered, with no chain of transmission in sight. At this point in time, it's too busy to test, save patients, let alone do a serious and meticulous epidemiological investigation, and no matter how many cases you actually diagnose and how many die, it's likely that the actual infection predicted is at least 5,000 to 10,000.

73\. Immediately lockdown, the virus has one or two more waves of infection within the family, 10,000 to 20,000 and 20,000 to 40,000, not to mention the aftermath of the latter half of the decline curve . The total number of infected people in China is 80,000 and 120,000 in Italy. What about the United States? The total number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths and the mortality rate are the topics that I will discuss below.

74\. Recalling the foregoing, in order to estimate the total number of confirmed cases and the total number of deaths, it is necessary to determine the point in time of the lockdown, followed by the apex of the normal distribution curve (still returning to the more intuitive normal curve), i.e. the peak of new confirmed cases and new deaths.

75\. The United States has a progressively tighter lockdown policy and the measures vary from state to state, and according to various indicators (White House, state directives, etc.), I have chosen 19 March as the date of the lockdown. Looking closely at the data, there is a coincidence, probably not coincidental, that a spike in the growth rate of the number of new cases will be seen around the date of the lockdown in China, Korea, Iran, Italy and the United States.

76\. Plague happen "naturally", but diagnoses are "man-made" events, and if on a given day the Government makes an important announcement, staff work harder and do more tests, and the result is more confirmed cases. On 27 January there was a small spike in the growth rate of new confirmed cases in China, and guess what happened? Of course, there is also the reverse logic, where growth rates accelerate and the government announces important decisions.

77\. The United States experienced a late peak in the growth rate of confirmed cases on 19 March, from 8074 to 12,018, a 49 per cent increase, reinforcing the rationale for the lockdown date of 19 March.

78\. With a lockdown date, and applying the previous formula, the peak of new confirmed cases would be after 10+7 or 10+5 days. There is no data available on the average time from onset to diagnosis in the United States, and considering that the U.S. detection capacity is very strong and expanding rapidly, I think the 5 day parameter is more appropriate. The 3-day parameter was not chosen because testing in the U.S. is not as convenient as in Korea.

79\. The first corollary to this is that the peak in the number of new confirmed cases in the United States will be 15 days after the lockdown date, i.e., 3 or 4 April (4 April is from the lockdown date of 20 March, the date on which the lockdown was issued in New York, the most infected city).

80\. Similarly, based on the aforementioned model, we can assume that the peak of new deaths in the United States is after 10+18 days, with 18 days being the average length of time from onset to death.

81\. This time parameter directly uses data from China, since, for example, 8 days in Italy does not apply to the United States, where the average infected person is younger, as in New York, the hardest-hit city, which is a haven for youth, and the crude mortality rate in the United States, which is lower than in China and much lower than in Italy, also proves that there are more young people infected, perhaps it is more appropriate to set this parameter at 20 days, tentatively at 18 days.

82\. A second inference can then be drawn that the peak of new deaths in the United States will be 28 days after the date of the lockdown, i.e. around 16 April.

83\. A more difficult question to answer below is the estimation of the total number of confirmed cases in the United States. This is difficult because the United States is still in the first half of the infection-normal curve and the trend is far from clear, unlike when the Italian data were previously estimated. Here I try to extrapolate separately in a number of ways.

84\. 1) Normal distribution curve fitting. The figure below is my own normal distribution curve fitted to the number of coronavirus confirmed cases in China, with an additional normal distribution curve fitted to the number of coronavirus deaths in China. Code available at: https://gist.github.com/mahavivo/646118d2c918a02202b4dba9c90ff608#gistcomment-3225530

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TXPk0u8ADCSs88-0E0tftg.png)

85\. Three positions are indicated in the figure: from left to right, the date of the lockdown, the position of the current situation in the United States relative to the entire normal distribution curve (8 days before the vertex), and the peak of the curve. We assume similar trends in the evolution of epidemics across countries in the case of lockdown, then if previous data for one country or region are known, it is possible to speculate by analogy about the state of change in another country.

86\. In my view, the better reference sample for the current time is Italy, although its situation is still developing, and China is the first country to have an epidemic and the early data distortions in the curve are so severe that they are of little reference value here. So let's see what the figures were for Italy and the US at the time of lockdown, respectively. Italy had a cumulative number of confirmed cases of 5,883 on March 7 lockdown and the United States had a cumulative number of confirmed cases of 12,018 on March 19 lockdown.

87\. Previously, we estimated the total number of confirmed cases in Italy to be between 120,000 and 150,000 (the result of the logistic function is 150,000), and now (26 March), in terms of data and trends, the whole figure has to be taken at a higher level, not less than 150,000, and calculated at 150,000. Then by simple analogy, the total number of confirmed cases in the US is 15 * 12018/5883 = 306,400.

88\. We have also established that the peak of confirmed cases in Italy was on 26 March and in the United States on 3 April. Now that we are 8 days away from the US peak, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the US is 75066, what was the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy 8 days before March 26? The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy on March 18 was 35713. By the same analogy, the total number of confirmed cases in the US would be 15 * 79313/35713 = 333,100.

89\. It should be added that I sometimes say that the time point for the Italian lockdown is 8-10 March, and sometimes 7 March, because I have chosen different indicators at different times, sometimes looking at the Government's executive order, sometimes looking at data such as growth rates, which are in the vicinity of this time point.

90\. 2) Reversal inference of the death toll. Infection occurs early, and testing is rushed forward only when it is suddenly discovered that it has been overwhelmed by the virus, which means that the first two months of infection are compressed to a month or half of testing, thus pushing up the steepness of the confirmed cases growth curve and causing distortion. But the gradual death curve is smooth, natural, and it responds to the "natural" process of infection, while the extent to which humans can intervene is currently limited.

91\. Thus, we can use the current number of deaths to infer the number of confirmed cases and onset of illnesses before several points in time. Previously we used the time of onset to determine the time of death, now it is reversed and the time of death is used to infer the time of onset (and the time of infection and the number of people infected at that time).

92\. Time of onset + 18 = time of death. Time of onset = time of death - 18. Time of onset after an incubation period (5 days) at the time of infection, time of infection = time of death - 18 - 5 = time of death - 23. That is, the current case of a death corresponds to a number of infected persons from 23 days ago, and the question to be estimated is, what is this "number"?

93\. A slight thought shows that it is in fact the reciprocal of the mortality rate. Because the US epidemic is not over now, it is not known, what we have now is the crude death rate (CDR), which is the number of existing deaths/cumulative number of confirmed cases, but based on the experience of SARS, MERS in Korea and coronavirus pandemic in China, this figure is roughly twice the early crude death rate. --The reason for this is that the peak of death is delayed from the peak of diagnosis.

94\. The current crude mortality rate in the United States is 1081/79313 = 1.36%, which doubles to 2.72%, and the reciprocal is 36.68, i.e., one death in the United States currently represents 37 infected persons from 23 days ago. The cumulative death toll is now 1081, which means that by 23 days, there were at least 1081 * 37 = 39997 infected people in the US.

95\. Also, because the number of people infected with the coronavirus doubles within 6 days (see related studies), so 23-6 = 17 days ago, there were 39997 * 2 ≈ 80,000 people infected, 17-6 = 11 days ago, there were 80,000 * 2 = 160,000 people infected and 11-6 = 5 days ago, there were 160,000 * 2 = 320,000 people infected.

96\. Five days ago was the second or third day of lockdown, and based on our previous analysis, it will continue to spread within families, but it won't be long before it can run rampant, and assuming it adds up to only half the people it can infect again, then 320,000 + 160,000 = 480,000 people. That is, the total number of confirmed cases in the U.S. that we estimate based on backward extrapolation is 480,000.

97\. 3) Polynomial fitting. Some might say that at first, seeing the normal distribution curve fitting, one would think it would be something advanced, only to throw out a broken graph, muddle through with the multiplicative division that even elementary school students know and be done with it. I can tell you that using function fitting to predict longer term data is usually very inaccurate, three or five days is okay, 10 days and 20 days away it flies into the sky, or the stack overflows, or it becomes a negative number, not as good as my oral calculation.

98\. A number of models have been tried out and the one that is currently found to be sloppy and acceptable is the polynomial fit, which is presented here for the third, fourth and eighth polynomials, respectively. The data I used for a total of 29 days were [15, 19, 24, 42, 57, 85, 111, 175, 252, 353, 497, 645, 936, 1205, 1598, 2163, 2825, 3501, 4373, 5662, 8074, 12018, 17438, 23710, 32341, 42752, 51825, 64107, 79313].

99\. The third polynomial fitting equation: Y = a + b*X + c*X2 + d*X3 . Parameters: a = -6627.34731169232 b = 3458.64278023616 c = -403.920473891768 d = 13.208292333362 Correlation factor R2: 0.991431207821127 . When X equals 35, i.e. the cumulative number of confirmed cases on 3 April Y = 163173, multiplied by 2, the total number of confirmed cases: 326346.

100\. Quadratic polynomial fitting equation: Y = a + b*X + c*X2 + d*X3 + e*X4 . Parameters: a = 1080.75947117255 b = -1003.37528963449 c = 239.285121228531 d = -19.7564849638339 e = 0.549412954953258 Correlation coefficient R2: 0.998947741537637 . x equals 35, i.e. cumulative number of confirmed cases on 3 April Y = 201271, multiplied by 2, total number of confirmed cases: 402542.

101\. Eight polynomial fitting equations: y = a + b*X + c*X2 + d*X3 + e*X4 + f*X5 + g*X6 + h*X7 + i*X8 . a = 3002.55287520578 b = -4722.4389728631 c = 2413.48705157712 d = -564.446049802626 e = 69.7258282396607 f = -4.81413519864233 g = 0.185935588677801 h = -0.00373692307274563 i = 3.04646136944272E-05.

102\. When X equals 35, i.e. the cumulative number of confirmed cases on 3 April is Y = 254225, multiplied by 2, the total number of people infected with coronavirus in the United States: 508450.

103\. A polynomial fit of the 29-day data described above is placed here, with eight polynomials. It is possible to fit it yourself using online tools, see: http://www.qinms.com/webapp/curvefit/cf.aspx, and the data extrapolation predictions are my own calculations in Python.

104\. The final data obtained by the three methods vary, ranging between 300,000 and 500,000, and I think it may be more appropriate to take the median (or average) figure, which is around 400,000.

105\. With the total number of confirmed cases, it is simple to estimate the total number of deaths, which can be multiplied by the death rate. The final mortality rate predicted earlier is the crude death rate * 2, which is 2.72%, then the total number of deaths would be 400,000 * 2.72% = about 10880.

106\. To summarize, the total number of people infected with coronavirus in the United States will reach about 400,000 (between 350,000 and 450,000), resulting in about 10,000 deaths (8,000-12,000), with the final mortality rate estimated at around 2.7 per cent (2.0-3.0 per cent). Its peak in the number of new confirmations came around April 3, and the peak in the number of new deaths came around April 16.

107\. Overall, Wuhan Coronavirus would result in between 350,000 – 450,000 confirmed cases and between 8,000 –12,000 deaths (with 2–3% mortality rate, doubling the current CDR 1.3%) in the US. Peak of confirmed cases is likely to reach on April 3, and peak of deaths is around April 16.

108\. Sorry, the previous polynomial fit is incorrect to say that X takes 35, it should be 37, because the last item in the list, 79313, is the number of March 26 ( check again, the wiki has changed the exact number), it has the number of 29, then by April 3, the number of 8 should be added to become 37, that is to say, two days less data, multiplied by two, is four days of data, with the current trend of 20,000 new daily, at least the estimated data is 80,000 less.

109\. I do not intend to revise this, however, because this function fit cannot be taken too seriously, just for reference: the total number of confirmed cases on 27 March is 100,000, and with six days to go before the peak on 3 April, when at least 20,000 are added to the day, then on 3 April it is 10 + 2 * 6 = 220,000, 220,000 and double = 440,000. So the previously stated 300,000-500,000 is going to move closer to the high 500,000 figure.

110\. Just two or three days later, the cumulative death toll in the United States has now risen alarmingly, jumping from 1081 (via wiki) to 2191 (via JHU), an ominous sign that could push the final death rate to as high as 4 percent in China. As mentioned above, also take the total number of confirmed cases to the high estimate of 500,000, and the final death toll would be 500,000 * 4% = 20,000. God Bless America.

111\. The article has been written at length and I intend to end the subject for the moment. Three main questions were discussed, 1) how to estimate the new confirmed cases peak and deaths peak after lockdown, 2) why lockdown and when lockdown, and 3) how to predict the total number of confirmed cases and total deaths based on the predicted confirmed cases peak and deaths peak. With this methodology and model, the initial assessment of the plague situation in other countries and regions (e.g. Germany, UK, Indonesia, India, Egypt, Brazil, etc.) should be relatively simple to make by analogy and, of course, being flexible to the specific situation.

112\. A lesson learned: the coronavirus is fierce, better exaggerated than trivialized; it is always even worse than you can imagine.
